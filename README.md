# NFL Player Stat Predictor 🏈  
**Full-Stack Sports Analytics Dashboard powered by R, Shiny, and Machine Learning**  
_Author: Jack Motta_

## 🔍 Overview

NFL Player Stat Predictor is an interactive R Shiny web application that predicts weekly NFL player performance for Quarterbacks (QBs), Running Backs (RBs), and Wide Receivers/Tight Ends (WR/TE). It leverages advanced data engineering, machine learning pipelines, and a custom-themed frontend to deliver real-time player stat forecasts in a production-ready format.

This project demonstrates full-stack R development — from data ingestion and modeling to UI/UX design — and showcases my ability to build end-to-end data products in a real-world sports analytics context.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Weekly Player Predictions**  
  Forecasts passing, rushing, and receiving stats using historical performance and contextual in-game features.

- **Advanced Modeling Pipeline**  
  Uses multi-response LASSO regression (`glmnet`) and rolling-origin cross-validation to handle time-series data and tune model hyperparameters.

- **Custom Shiny Dashboard**  
  Clean, mobile-friendly interface with player headshots, dynamic tables, dark mode styling (`bslib`), and fully interactive components.

- **Metrics Tab**  
  Explains RMSE and R-squared for non-technical users while displaying model diagnostics across each position group.

- **Extensive Data Engineering**  
  Aggregates, merges, and cleans player and game-level data from:
  - `nflreadr` (core player stats)
  - `nflfastR` (game context)
  - ESPN QBR
  - NextGen Stats
  - Pro Football Reference (advanced stats)

## 📊 Model Metrics

Each position group is trained on its own dataset with engineered features tailored to how that position contributes on the field.

**Performance Metrics Used:**

- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):**  
  Measures average prediction error in the unit of the stat. In this domain, an RMSE that’s ~10–20% of a stat’s range is often solid.

- **R-squared (R²):**  
  Indicates how much variation is explained by the model. In real-world settings like NFL performance prediction, R² values between 0.3–0.5 (or lower) are common due to high game-to-game variance and external factors like game flow, weather, and injuries.

_The app’s "Metrics" tab includes both the numbers and beginner-friendly explanations to help contextualize model performance._

|---------------------------|-------------|
| `QB_Stat_Pred.qmd`, `RB_Stat_Pred.qmd`, `WR_TE_Stat_Pred.qmd`            | The primary Quarto notebook containing end-to-end analysis, feature engineering, modeling, and evaluation for predicting NFL player stats. Designed for reproducibility and readability. |
| `QB_Stat_Pred.html`, `RB_Stat_Pred.html`, `WR_TE_Stat_Pred.html`           | The rendered HTML output of qmd files, viewable in-browser. Use this for quick viewing of the project without needing to run code. |
| `app.R`               | The Shiny application that allows users to interactively explore predictions, player trends, and model outputs. Launches a dynamic web app using the trained models and feature outputs. |
| `qbr_missing_cleaned.csv` | A manually cleaned dataset of missing QBR records not returned by `nflreadr::load_espn_qbr()`. This file supplements incomplete ESPN QBR data and ensures full model coverage. |
| `www/`                | Contains image assets used in the Shiny app, including visuals generated by OpenAI's DALL·E. This folder is automatically used by Shiny to serve static content like logos or background images. |

## 💼 Why This Project Stands Out

This project simulates a real-world workflow in data science and applied modeling:

- **End-to-End Ownership**  
  Covers data collection, preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, and interactive presentation.

- **Real-World Constraints**  
  Handles noisy and volatile data in a domain (sports) where perfect prediction is unrealistic — and embraces it with transparent metric explanations.

- **Clear Communication**  
  Bridges the gap between technical output and human interpretation with a polished user interface and intuitive insights.

- **Production-Ready Workflow**  
  Designed with maintainability in mind — modularized data cleaning, modeling, and deployment-ready `.parquet` outputs.

This project serves as both a practical tool and a demonstration of applied modeling, reproducibility, and front-end integration in R.
